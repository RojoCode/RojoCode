- 👋 Hi, I’m @RojoCode. I am currently studying energy technologie in Germany. In my studies I have only learned Matlab, but I want to learn how to make use of a programming language for a innovative energy topic.
- 👀 I’m interested in python data processing. I already worked with RabbitMQ and want to learn more about all the sweet possabilities that come with it.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning python data analysis and visualisation. Along with it I want to learn how event loops work for a efficient data process. I have not used Java Script yet but this is something I want to get into aswell.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on a python module that processes, validates and visualises measurement data.
- 📫 I have worked with git and redmine a bit for my work.
